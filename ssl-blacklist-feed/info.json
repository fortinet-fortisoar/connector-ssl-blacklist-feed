  "description": "The SSL Blacklist (SSLBL) is a project of abuse.ch with the goal of detecting malicious SSL connections, by identifying and blacklisting SSL certificates used by botnet C&C servers. In addition, SSLBL identifies JA3 fingerprints that helps you to detect & block malware botnet C&C communication on the TCP layer. This connector facilitates automated operations related to fetching the list of IPs blacklist.<br/><br/>This connector has a dependency on the <a href=\"/content-hub/all-content/?contentType=solutionpack&amp;tag=ThreatIntelManagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Threat Intel Management Solution Pack</a>.
